## 💡 Pro Tips

### Optimize Performance

- **Use Recommended Workers**: N-1 cores (leaves one for your system)
- **Start Small**: Test with 100 builds first
- **Lower Multiplier**: Use 50% for faster initial tests
- **Select Fewer Substats**: Reduces build complexity

### Prevent Data Loss

- **Checkpoints**: Automatic every 5 minutes
- **Don't Worry About Crashes**: Resume from checkpoint on restart
- **Keep Disk Space**: Ensure 1GB+ free space

### Understand Results

- **Win Rate**: Percentage of battles won (higher is better)
- **DPS**: Damage per second (offensive power)
- **HP**: Maximum health (defensive power)
- **Balance**: Best builds balance offense and defense

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Too Many Builds**: Starting with 10,000+ builds takes hours  
✅ **Start Small**: Begin with 100-1000 builds

❌ **All Substats Selected**: Increases complexity and time  
✅ **Core Stats Only**: Focus on 5-7 key substats

❌ **100% Multiplier Always**: Slower for testing  
✅ **Adjust Multiplier**: Use 50% for quick tests

❌ **Closing Without Saving**: Losing progress  
✅ **Trust Checkpoints**: They save automatically
